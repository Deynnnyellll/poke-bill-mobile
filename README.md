# Bill Splitter (Pokémon-themed) 👋

A bill-splitting app styled like a Pokémon-game encounter: a typewriter-effect dialog box, badges, and a step-by-step "party" flow guide you through logging a bill and splitting it between trainers (people). Built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and Expo Router.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- Web browser (`npm run web`)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## App flow

- **Home** (`src/app/index.jsx`) — encounter/splash screen introducing the Bill Splitter.
- **Party** (`src/app/party.jsx`) — add the people ("party members") splitting the bill; each member is assigned a Pokémon-type color badge.
- **Log** (`src/app/log.jsx`) — log the items/amounts on the bill.
- **Explore** (`src/app/explore.tsx`) — secondary tab.

Shared UI pieces live in `src/components/` (`screen-header.jsx`, `screen-footer.jsx`), the Pokémon color/typography palette is in `src/constants/pokemon-theme.ts`, and the dialog-box typing effect is powered by the `useTyper` hook (`src/hooks/useTyper.jsx`).

## Project structure

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) rooted at `src/app`. Per this project's conventions:

- New route files are authored as `.jsx` (not `.tsx`); existing `.tsx` files don't need to be converted.
- Platform-specific behavior uses Expo/Metro's extension resolution (e.g. `app-tabs.tsx` vs `app-tabs.web.tsx`).
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `src/*`, and `@/assets/*` maps to `assets/`.

See `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for more detailed conventions used when developing this project with AI coding agents.

## Other setup steps

- To set up ESLint for linting, run `npm run lint` (`expo lint`), or follow the guide on ["Using ESLint and Prettier"](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-eslint/).
- If you'd like to set up unit testing, follow the guide on ["Unit Testing with Jest"](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/) — there is no configured test runner in this repo yet.
- Learn more about the TypeScript setup in this template in the guide on ["Using TypeScript"](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/).
